title: Battleship
---

Battleship is a very simple game, based on the eponymous [board game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_%28game%29).

It was a school project during October 2012 ( first year at [Creajeux](https://www.creajeux.fr/) ), I had two weeks to do it. I did a very bad project, so during the summer holidays of 2014, I remade this game in one week. Even if I lacked time to do what I really wanted, particularly on the Artificial Intelligence, I am pretty happy about the upgrade of this project.

The original project had to be made in C, so I did the upgrade in C too. For this I used the C binding of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) ( [CSFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/) ). I worked with Visual Studio 2012.

The principle of the game is simple, place your own ships, launch the game and try to sink the enemiesâ€™ ship.
