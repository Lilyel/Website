title: Super Small Boat
---

Super Small Boat is a 2D horizontal never ending shooter.

That was my first game using the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) ( Simple and Fast Multimedia Library ) and C++, with Visual Studio 2010 C++ Express.

I made this game to increase my new skills in C++ ( polymorphism, inheritance, STL ).

I made that game at the end of my first year at [Creajeux](https://www.creajeux.fr/) during the summer holiday.

I made my own animation system and data manager.

In the game, the player will play a fisherman who defends himself against evil fishesâ€™ defenders.

The player can pick up power ups which help him to fight or protect himself.

The more you collect coins, greater the weapons will be and the game difficulty will increase with time.
