title: Firefly

Firefly is a very simple puzzle game on android device in 2D.

I made this game in around 12 hours of work shared on three days on my spare time. I wanted to create quickly a mobile game because so far I only did Windows games so for challenging purposes I wanted a little challenge so I decided to do it in 3 days maximum.

I used Unity3D to do this game. I hesitated between Unity and Unreal Engine 4, and even if I love Unreal, I have chosen Unity because the experience demands for developers on mobile is higher on Unity. But I will try a next time to do another project with Unreal.

The game’s principle looks like another project of mine ( CreaSkeek ). There is a ball and the player has to bring it to the arrival case. The goal is to collect all fireflies in a minimum of time.

The gameplay is simple, there are two movement axes, horizontal and vertical. The player just has to slide with one finger in the direction he wants to move.

There are 6 levels, I tried to do an increasing difficulty. In each level, the player can discover a new feature. In the first level, I made a little tutorial to explain the gameplay. And the final level is a complex mix of all features.

There are different features, like the teleporter which moves the player to its color matching output. There are also red fireflies which are blocking the player’s progression so the player has to collect a key and transform them in yellow fireflies to unlock the way.

You can find the apk download link below pictures. Download and copy it on your android device and then install it via a file explorer. I tested Firefly on Nvidia Shield Tablet ( Lollipop ) and Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 ( KitKat ).
