    <h1>JanKen Battle Arena</h1>
    <p>
        JanKen Battle Arena is a fighting game mixed with “Rock Paper Scissors”, that is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bakcorpstudio.jba&hl=en">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jan-ken-battle-arena/id1160328096">iOS</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is developed by Bakcorp Studio, a small video game studio based in Montpellier (France). When I joined the studio, there were the boss a developer, another gameplay developer, an illustrator and two 2D animators, then finally, a community manager who also helped the boss to create sounds and musics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I joined them on early November 2015 within the context of my internship. Then I was hired for two months to help to ship the game and then I have chosen to continue my studies in an university.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game is developed using Unity3D (C#) and Visual Studio 2012. We used PlasticSCM as source control.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Summary</h2>
    <p>
        In the game, the player can possess several spirits, he can equip them with a weapon and a shield, improve their spells or unlock new ones. Then, the player can fight another player or an artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
        During the fight, there are, at first, three symbols : rock, paper and scissors. The player has to choose one, then the opponent's symbol is revealed. If the player wins, the spirit attacks the enemy, if he loses his spirit is attacked by the adversary's one. Spells can be chosen just after the symbol if the spirit has enough Doki (energy).

    <p>
        In case of a draw, the winner will be determined thanks to a mini game. In those games, players have to trace circles, tap the screen or slice a symbol as fast as possible. The fastest player will win the round.

    <p>
        At the end of the fight, the players win some gold (more for the winner). Gold is used in the gift machine to get new stuff or some components to improve spells or purchase new spirits.
