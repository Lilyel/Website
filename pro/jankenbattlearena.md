JanKen Battle Arena is a fighting game mixed with “Rock Paper Scissors”, that is available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bakcorpstudio.jba&hl=en) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jan-ken-battle-arena/id1160328096).

It is developed by Bakcorp Studio, a small video game studio based in Montpellier (France). When I joined the studio, there were the boss a developer, another gameplay developer, an illustrator and two 2D animators, then finally, a community manager who also helped the boss to create sounds and musics.

I joined them on early November 2015 within the context of my internship. Then I was hired for two months to help to ship the game and then I have chosen to continue my studies in an university.​

The game is developed using Unity3D (C#) and Visual Studio 2012. We used PlasticSCM as source control.
