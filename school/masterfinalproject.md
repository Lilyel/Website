title: Audiovisual Project
---

This project was a practical work for the University during my second year of my master degree.

The objective was to implement a part of a scientific paper *AniPaint: interactive painterly animation from video*. This article explains a stylization technique for video.

We focused only on a single image instead of a video, so the time aspect was ignored. We successfully implemented the brush stroke generation which depends on the source image and the different constrains described in the paper.

All our reports, presentations and results can be found on the master website (french) : [http://fsi-dpt-info.univ-tlse3.fr/master-igai/2017-g1/](http://fsi-dpt-info.univ-tlse3.fr/master-igai/2017-g1/)
