title: Protokit Island
---

Protokit Island is a racing game with a small RPG dimension.

It was our project for the end of the second year in cooperation with [Frederick Raynal](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9rick_Raynal).  We had approximatly 8 weeks to do it.

We used Unity3D and worked in collaboration with the second year artists of the school ([Creajeux](http://www.creajeux.fr/)).

My task on this project was to make the physcal part of the car which was quite challenging. The vehicule had to react differently according to the surface it drove on and all the pieces it was composed by. So it brought many obstacle to the developing process such as the wheel physical behavior and global vehicule handling. The other problematic was that I had no notions in kinematics or any other type of physical comportment of an automobile.

The car we created and the game in general worked well in the end which was trully satisfying.
